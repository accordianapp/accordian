## üöÄ Setup Guide for Server Owners

### Prerequisites

- A Discord server where you have Administrator permissions
- A Stripe account (free at stripe.com)
- A server or hosting service to run the bot (DigitalOcean, Railway, Heroku, etc.)

### Step 1: Discord Bot Setup

1. Create a bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Enable these Privileged Gateway Intents:
   - SERVER MEMBERS INTENT
   - MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
3. Invite bot to your server with these permissions:
   - Manage Roles
   - Send Messages
   - Read Messages/View Channels

### Step 2: Create Your Roles

1. In Discord Server Settings > Roles, create your membership tiers:
   - Basic Member
   - Premium Member
   - VIP Member (or whatever you want)
2. **IMPORTANT:** Position the bot's role ABOVE your membership roles
3. Copy each Role ID (right-click > Copy Role ID with Developer Mode enabled)

### Step 3: Create Payment Log Channel

1. Create a private channel (e.g., #payment-logs)
2. Only admins should see this channel
3. Copy the Channel ID (right-click > Copy Channel ID)

### Step 4: Configure Stripe

1. Go to https://stripe.com and create products for each tier:
   - Create ONE product per tier (e.g., "Basic Membership")
   - Add TWO prices to each product:
     - One-time payment price
     - Monthly subscription price
2. Copy all the Price IDs (they start with `price_...`)
3. Set up a webhook endpoint pointing to your bot's URL + `/webhook`
4. Copy your Stripe Secret Key and Webhook Secret

### Step 5: Configure the Bot

Edit `config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  serverSettings: {
    paymentLogChannelId: 'YOUR_CHANNEL_ID_HERE',
    welcomeMessage: 'Customize your welcome message here! Use {username} as placeholder.',
    paymentSuccessMessage: 'Customize success message! Use {tier} as placeholder.',
  },

  roles: {
    basic: {
      name: 'Basic Member',
      roleId: 'YOUR_ROLE_ID',
      description: 'What members get with this tier',
      oneTime: {
        price: 9.99,
        stripePriceId: 'price_xxxxx'
      },
      subscription: {
        monthlyPrice: 4.99,
        stripePriceId: 'price_yyyyy'
      }
    },
    // Add more tiers as needed
  }
};
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_application_id
GUILD_ID=your_server_id

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx

PORT=3000
WEBHOOK_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

4. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard
5. Get your public URL from Railway

#### Option B: DigitalOcean

1. Create a droplet
2. Install Node.js
3. Clone your repo
4. Run `npm install`

  description: 'Premium features',
  oneTime: { price: 29.99, stripePriceId: 'price_xxx' },
